There are individual readme.txt files explaining how to run the program in an IDE.

If you want to run it from terminal follow the instructions below and pass in the arguments specified in the application specific readme.txt.

To compile and execute the program:

1. Navigate to the correct directory that contains the jars

2. Run the jar code using the command:
    java -jar jarName.jar [arguments]	


IMPORTANT:

IF YOU COPY AND PASTE THE COMMANDS TO RUN THE JAR, IT MAY NOT WORK DUE TO THE DIFFERENT FORMATTING OF THE QUOTATION MARKS. PLEASE CHANGE THE QUOTATION MARKS ONCE COPIED INTO TERMINAL OR WRITE THE COMMANDS OUT MANUALLY.

THANK YOU
